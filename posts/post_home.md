### Architecture Overview

*Recall: Regular Neural Nets.* As we saw in the previous chapter, Neural Networks receive an input (a single vector), and transform it through a series of *hidden layers*. Each hidden layer is made up of a set of neurons, where each neuron is fully connected to all neurons in the previous layer, and where neurons in a single layer function completely independently and do not share any connections. The last fully-connected layer is called the "output layer" and in classification settings it represents the class scores.

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
